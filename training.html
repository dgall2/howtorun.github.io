Running is like other physical activity. The more you do it, the better you become. However, there are countless approaches to improve running performance.

<div id="open-garmin">
    <p><h4>Fitness Trackers: Running Watch</h4>
        In order to measure distance, pace, heart rate, and other data, fitness trackers like Garmin watches (below) have long been used. GPS and biometric technology can pinpoint where on your run you almost threw up.

  <div id="open-work">
    <p><h4>Workouts: Fartleks, Tempos, Intervals</h4>
        Steady runs can only get you so fit. In order to gain a larger training volume at a higher intensity, workouts like long-interval fartleks (which mean 'speed play') can be used.

  <div id="open-strava">
    <p><h4>Social Sites: Strava</h4>
What good is a gps watch and a long workout if you can't brag about it to your friends on Strava? Immediately find yourself surrounded by endless training posts with subliminal captions and a growing sense of competitiveness with your followers.   </p>

  <div id="open-recovery">
    <p><h4>Recovery: Compression, Icing, Rolling, Stretching</h4>
Gains are made when the damage done during exercise is recovered and rebuilt. Injuries occur when training load exceeds recovery. Since this is key, runners can turn to a large assortment of tools in order to work out any soreness.

  <div id="open-aqua">
    <p><h4>Crosstraining: Aquajogging, Lifting</h4>
        A common word in running is mitigating 'impact'. To minimize impact on joints, alternative approaches such a aquajogging and lifting are used. If you thought running was boring, wait until you do it in a dingy pool, staring at a wall the whole time.
