Supplementation and diet can greatly improve health and running performance. While it can be boiled down to 'a good diet  makes you feel good', the upper eschelons of hypochondriacs and blood-doping professionals dive much further,   </div>

<div id="open-whey">
    <p><h4>Protein: Whey, Casein, Plant, Animal</h4>
        Protein is the most important macronutrient for runners. Protein is used to rebuild muscle. While carbs and fats are important energy sources, increased protein consumption positively impacts recovery.

  <div id="open-carbs">
    <p><h4>Carbs & Glycemic Index</h4>
Runners and carbs have a loving relationship. 'Pasta dinners', 'carbo-loading', and other running-related carb-rich diets are a well-known thing. Without them, running would be very difficult due to the intense metabolic demands of the sport.

  <div id="open-advil">
    <p><h4>Ibuprofen</h4>
Shin Splints? Ibuprofen. Soreness? Ibuprofen. Injury of any kind? Odds are ibuprofen's going to help. Though it has become a sort of meme, anti-inflammatories are a crucial part of load-management and treating small flare-ups.

  <div id="open-beta-alanine">
    <p><h4>Lactic Acid Buffers: Beta Alanine</h4>
The burning sensation during intense physical activity like endurance running and sprinting is due to lactic acid buildup in muscles as a result of anaerobic resporation in a low-oxygen situation. Beta alanine, among other similar supplements, buffers the pH of the lactic acid and improves anaerobic performance capabilities. </p> Rating: 6/10 Intense Side Effects

  <div id="open-epo">
    <p><h4>Doping: EPO, Transfusions</h4>
        For informative purposes only. The term 'doping' often refers to taking PEDs. In the sport of running, illegal methods of increasing aerobic capacity, like doubling your red blood cell count unnaturally, have been used (and quickly discovered).
