<div id="description">

    Running is heralded as a natural pattern of human movement. <br>All you need is air and gravity. However, some modern advancements in gear <br> make running a bit more safe and enjoyable... and a bit less free-of-charge.

    <p><h4>Running Shoes: Daily Trainer</h4>
    The Brooks Ghost (pictured) is a good example of a quality daily trainer. An important purchase for all runners, a solid workhorse trainer is a wise investment.

    <p><h4>Running Shorts: 2" Inseam Splits</h4>
    Here you've decided to ditch the baggy gym shorts and brave the elements (and embarrassment) in a pair of running shorts. Too short? "It's what real runners wear".

    <p><h4>Running Hat: 5-Panel Lid</h4>
    People won't know whether you're headed out to a craft brewery, go rock climbing, or run.. Or maybe all three. Running hats instantly grant style points while doing a good job with sweat and sunlight.

    <p><h4>Sunglasses: Oakley Single-Lenses</h4>
        The flashier the sunglasses, the more you'll look like a house music DJ. Sunglasses like these have long been worn by endurance athletes, with varying degrees of douchiness.

    <p><h4>Carbon-Plated Footwear</h4>
        Running shoe technology has exploded in recent years. Brands like Nike are pushing the boundaries of human/footwear performance, resulting in crazy prototypes, broken records, and soaring prices.
